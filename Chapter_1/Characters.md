# Types of Playable Characters

- Warrior class: HP Growth 19: highest damage induction, basically when you get hit by a warrior your HP goes down faster than the rest
- Wizard class: HP Growth 9: uses magic
- Cleric class: HP Growth 14: uses support magic
- Rogue class: HP Growth 13: highest consistent melee/ranged damage

## Thinking out loud

- Game should have these:

  - Class levels so characters can level up
  - Battle system - Turn Based
  - World levels
  - Different Monsters

  - Shops:
    - Purchase Equipment
    - Purchase consumables like elixirs for HP/MP

- pwTypes.h:

  - The file where we define the datatype(unsigned integer) for the Hit points of our characters

- hpHeader.h
  - The file contains the class definition for the various Hit Points used throught out our program.
